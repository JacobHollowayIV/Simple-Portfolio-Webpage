    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    
     <p>On the weekends you can find me on keyboards as a wedding and church musician, and in my down-time, board gaming with family and friends. </p>

    <p>I have been in music for over 25 years. The lessons and hard-work needed to survive as a semi-professional musician have translated over to my journey as a developer. In additiona, all the knowledge I gained as a Chase employee and former salesman, both in the corporate space, have helped to build my problem solving, communication, and teamwork skills.</p>
